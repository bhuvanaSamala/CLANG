<h2>CHAPTER 1 : PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY</h2>
<p>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
A computer is an electronic machine with the capability of performing variety of tasks

The computer cannot perform these tasks directly. It simply follows the instructions given by the user. So a user has to instruct the computer what it is suppose to do, in a form which a computer can understand.

A computer program is nothing but a set of instructions. Many programming languages evolved 'for the purpose of writing programs.

To solve the problem correctly, the user has to give correct instructions. The result from the computer depends on the instructions. If the instructions are correct then the result will be correct otherwise result will be wrong. The process of creating programs is known as programming) Computer programming is the process of writing, testing, debugging/troubleshooting, and maintaining the computer programs.<br/>

<b>Programming methodology</b> deals with the analysis, design and implementation of programs
<h3>STEPS INVOLVED IN PROGRAMMING</h3>

Following Series of Steps can Develop a Good Program :<br/>

1.Defining the problem.<br/>
2.Designing the algorithm.<br/>
3.Coding the program.<br/>
4.Testing and debugging the program.<br/>
5.Implementing the program.<br/>
6.Maintaining and implementing the program.<br/> 
<b>1.Defining the Problem :</b>It involves recognizing the problem; identifying exactly what the problem is; determining the available input and desired output; deciding whether the problem can be solved by using the computer.<br/>
<b>2.Designing the Algorithm : </b>An algorithm is the finite set of step-by-step instructions that solve a program. After defining the problem, algorithm can be designed.<br/>
<b>3.Coding the Program :</b> It involves actually writing the instructions in a particular language that tell the computer how to operate.<br/> 
<b>4.Testing and Debugging the Program : </b>After coding, the program must be tested to ensure that it is correct and contains no errors. Three types of errors or bugs can be found which are<br/> 


Syntax error or Logic error o Run time error.<br/>

<b>Syntax Error :</b> Syntax is a set of rules by which a programming language is governed. Syntax error occurs when these rules are violated while coding of the program.<br/><b>Logic Error :</b> Improper coding of individual statements either or sequence of statements causes this type of computer program error. It does not stop program execution but gives wrong results.<br/><b>Run Time Error : </b>This error in a computer program stops its execution. It may be caused by entry of invalid data.<br/><b>
5. Implementing the Program :</b> After a program has been listed and debugged, it can be installed and implemented.<br/>
<b>6.Maintaining and Upgrading the Program :</b> After a program is developed and implemented can be upgraded as per the requirements of the user. Maintaining and upgrading the program is an ongoing process. 

<h3>DEFINE ALGORITHM</h3>

The word algorithm comes from the word <b>Al-Khowzmi,</b> the Arabian inventor and means recipe, method technique or procedure.<br/>

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm, self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/ or automated reasoning tasks.<br/>

An informal definition could be "a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations.<br/>

Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including natural languages, pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts, programming languages or control tables (processed by interpreters). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms.Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts and control tables are structured to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural langua statements. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer, but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.<br/>

<h3>LIST FOUR CHARACTERISTICS OF ALGORITHM</h3>

<h5>The characteristics of an algorithm are :<h5>

1.It should be simple.<br/>
2.It should be clear with no ambiguity.<br/>
3.It should lead to a unique solution of the problem.<br/>
4.It should involve a finite number of steps to arrive at a solution.<br/> 

And It should have the capability to handle some unexpected situations which may se during the solution of a problem.

<h3>DEFINE A PROGRAM</h3>

A computer program, or program, is a sequence of instructions, written to perform a specified task with a computer. A computer requires programs to function, which executes the program's instructions in a central processor. The program has an executable form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions. A collection of computer programs and related data is referred to as the software. Programs are written by programmers in programming languages.

<h3>STEPS INVOLVED IN ALGORITHM</h3>

Algorithm design is a specific method to create a mathematical proceqs in solving problems. Applied algorithm design is algorithm engineering.

Algorithm design is identified and incorporated into many solution theories of operation research, such as dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer. Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are algorithm design patterns, such as template method pattern and decorator pattern, and uses of data structures, and name and sort lists. Some current day uses of algorithm design can be found in internet retrieval processes of web crawling, packet routing and caching.

<h5>Steps involved in Developing an Algorithm :</h5>

1.Problem definition.<br/>
2.Development of a model.<br/>
3.Specification of Algorithm.<br/>
4.Designing an Algorithm.<br/>
5.Checking the correctness of Algorithm. <br/>
6.Analysis of Algorithm.<br/>
7.Implementation of Algorithm.<br/>
8.Program testing.<br/>
9.Documentation Preparation.<br/> 

<h5>Advantages and Disadvantages of Algorithm :</h5>

1. It is a step by step solution to a given problem which is very easy to understand.<br/>

2. It has got a definite procedure which can be exacted within a set period of time.<br/>

3.It is easy to first develop an algorithm, then convert it into a flowchart and then into a computer program.<br/>

4.It has got a beginning and an end within which there are definite procedures
to produce outputs within a specified period of time.<br/>

5.It is easy to debug as every step has got its own logical sequence.<br/>

6.It is independent of programming languages. <br/>


<b>Disadvantages :</b> It is time consuming and cumbersome as an algorithm is developed first which is converted into flow chart and then into a computer program.

A flow chart is a diagrammatic or pictorial representation of the algorithm or of the plan of solution of a problem. It indicates the process of solution, the relevant operations and computations, the point of decision and other information which is a part of the solution.

Flow charts are very useful for documenting a program. They are constructed by using special geometrical symbols. Each symbol represents an activity. Flow charts are read from top to bottom unless a branch alters the normal flow.
